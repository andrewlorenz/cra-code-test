# Instructions

- npm i
- npm start

find the bugs and fix them !

- get all the features of the site working
- remove all errors and warnings from the console
- watch out, there are some obvious but also some very subtle bugs to find

Add a comment such as // FIX - blah blah
above each bug as you find and fix it,
so you can see how many you found after the exercise
(and the ones you missed!)
